    <h1>How Does Color Code Work?</h1>
    <p>Hello, everyone! Kyle Huang here. This article will detail how this website, "Color Code", works. First, understand that text can be converted to a numerical value. Here, I used ASCII, also known as American Standard Code for Information Exchange. When you type in anything into the input box, the first thing that happens is that it is divided into chunks of 3 characters. Each character in each chunk is converted to its numerical equivalent. Now that we have a bunch of sets of 3 numbers, we can convert these to an image. You see, an image is merely a collection of pixels, and each pixel is a color. A color can be represented by 3 values: red, green, and blue. The first number in a chunk is the red value, the second is the green value, and the third is the blue value. This is repeated, with pixels being put down until the message is finished.</p>
